### Notes
- **Customization**: Replace placeholders like `your-username`, `<username>`, `<password>`, `<dbname>`, and `<your-secret-key>` with your actual values.
- **Screenshots**: I included placeholder image links. Replace them with real screenshots of your app (upload to GitHub or an image host like Imgur).
- **Structure**: Assumes a separate `backend` and `frontend` folder. Adjust if your repo is different.
- **Enhancements**: Added tables, code blocks, and sections for a polished look.
